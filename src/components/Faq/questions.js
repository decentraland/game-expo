      <p>
        Launched in 2020, Decentraland is a virtual social world, the first
        decentralized metaverse, and the only one that is open source. Within
        the Decentraland platform, which can run on a browser or desktop client,
        users can create, experience, and monetize content and applications as
        well as socialize and attend a wide range of daily, community-driven
        events. Decentraland is unique in that it is owned, created, and
        governed by the people who use it every day. Through Decentraland’s
        decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) users can submit proposals
        and even apply for grants for the community to vote on.

    question: "Where can I find special Wearables and Emotes for my avatar?",
    answer: () => (
      <p>
        To customize your digital identity beyond the free Wearables and Emotes
        available to all users, you can explore hundreds of unique
        community-made items in Decentraland's Marketplace, all waiting to be
        discovered by you!

    question:
      "Do I need cryptocurrency or a digital wallet to use Decentraland?",
    answer: () => (
      <p>
        You do not need to own cryptocurrency to enjoy Decentraland as it is
        free to use. If you decide to purchase a community-made creation from
        the Marketplace, there are multiple payment options available, such as
        credit/debit card and bank transfer in addition to various
        cryptocurrencies.
        <br />
        <br />
        As for owning a <a href="https://docs.decentraland.org/player/blockchain-integration/get-a-wallet/" target="_blank">digital wallet</a>, if you don't already have one, you don't
        need to get one yourself if you don't want to. When you sign-in to
        Decentraland for the first time—creating your account—a digital wallet
        will be created for you behind the scenes, it's as simple as that!
        <br />
        <br />
        This digital wallet is part of your Decentraland account and is used to
        store any digital assets you acquire, such as free Wearables you might
        claim in-world or a fun Emote you purchase in the Marketplace.
